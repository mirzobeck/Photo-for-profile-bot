About this Font
     This font is distributed as shareware as part of a promotion for the
Scriptorium Font Library.
     If you use this font for thirty days or for any publication or
commercial purpose you are obligated to register it as shareware.
     To register the font you may pay a $5 registration fee to Ragnarok, or
you may order a sampler disk or the disk on which the font is featured for
$15.  The later option is the best deal because you'll get a whole disk of
legitimate, registered fonts for a very low price.
     If for some reason you wish to distribute this font as part of a
shareware collection or package, please contact us first at the address
(netmail or US Mail) or phone number given below.
     The rest of this is our standard catalog.  If you like this font you'll
love some of the hundred-plus other fonts in the Scriptorium Font Library.


The Scriptorium Font Library
     The Scriptorium Font Library is a collection of fonts designed by Dave
Nalle of Ragnarok Games for use in their publications, but now available to
the public by direct mail.  The emphasis of the collection is on original
display fonts, unique historically based calligraphy, foreign language and
unusual decorative art fonts. Unlike large font houses which produce cloned
packages of the same 100 standard fonts, we offer high quality fonts you've
never seen before and can't get anywhere else.
     Provided here is an up to date listing of all the font disks available
at this time.  Each disk includes as many fonts as we can fit on it (usually
8 to 12 fonts). They are fully registered when you purchase the disk.

Church Slavonic.  $15.  Update $5.
